# direct-democracy


Democracy is something we are all a part of to keep running and working properly. Thanks to technology, we now have the ability to join as a collective and discuss and share how we think things should run as never before. This open source project plans to empower those who before have had to rely solely on being represented. We should be able to hold those who are in power accountable for their actions, and this plans on doing just that.
